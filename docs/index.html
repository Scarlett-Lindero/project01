    <h1>When Birth Becomes an Emergency: Delivering Under Pressure in Mexico</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Scarlett Lindero</p>

    <p>In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as "emergency procedures."</p>

    <iframe title="Six in ten births in Mexico are by C-section" aria-label="Gráfico de círculo" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2PmGg/3/" height="514"></iframe>

    <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>

    <blockquote><em>"Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time,"</em> explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.</blockquote>

    <h2>A System That Centralizes and Excludes</h2>
    <p>Mexico's healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer...</p>

    <h2>Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h2>
    <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses—like "fetal distress" or "cephalopelvic disproportion"...</p>

    <h2>The Numbers Don’t Lower Mortality</h2>
    <p>C-section rates vary across states, but all exceed the 15% threshold recommended by the WHO...</p>

    <p>In 2024, 76 maternal deaths were documented during childbirth. In 73.7% of cases, the delivery was handled by an OB-GYN...</p>

    <h2>Giving Birth Without a Specialist</h2>
    <p>The data also shows that in many hospitals, hundreds—or even thousands—of births were attended without a certified OB-GYN...</p>

    <h2>When Choice Isn’t Really an Option</h2>
    <p>Lack of information also shapes many women’s experience in the obstetric system...</p>

    <h2>The Price of What’s Left Unspoken</h2>
    <p>The routine use of C-sections comes at a high cost for the healthcare system...</p>

    <h2>What Needs to Change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthen primary care to manage uncomplicated births.</li>
      <li>Bring midwives back into the public system.</li>
      <li>Ensure safe, informed, and respectful births as a basic right.</li>
      <li>Redesign hospitals to honor movement, privacy, and the natural timing of birth.</li>
      <li>Open a public conversation about the risks of normalizing surgery as the default.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Mexico, birth has become a surgical intervention. As C-section rates continue to rise, the structural conditions that make them inevitable remain unaddressed. Placing this debate at the center is not just a matter of public health: it’s a matter of rights.</p>
