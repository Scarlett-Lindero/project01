        <p><strong>When Birth Becomes an Emergency: Delivering Under Pressure in Mexico</strong><br><em>By Scarlett Lindero</em></p>
        <p>In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as "emergency procedures."</p>

        <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>
        <p><em>"Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time," explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.</em></p>

        <h2>A System That Centralizes and Excludes</h2>
        <p>Mexico's healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer. The first level—clinics and health centers—is meant to manage uncomplicated pregnancies. The second, composed of general hospitals, handles obstetric emergencies and more complex cases. The third includes highly specialized hospitals.</p>
        <p>Since 2010, public policy has focused on moving births to second-level hospitals, following international recommendations that frame them as safer. The National Strategy to Reduce Maternal Mortality shifted obstetric care to these hospitals, effectively disabling many first-level units—even those with trained personnel, proper equipment, and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The result is a saturated hospital system unable to support physiological birth. What was once an exception has become a tool for managing overcrowded hospitals.</p>
        <p><em>"What Seguro Popular did was shut down the first level—it didn’t strengthen it. Now, hospitals are overrun with births that could be handled elsewhere," says Argüello.</em></p>

        <h2>Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h2>
        <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses—like "fetal distress" or "cephalopelvic disproportion"—which, while possible, have become routine justifications for fast intervention.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="mortality">
        <h2>The Numbers Don’t Lower Mortality</h2>
        <p>In 2024, 76 maternal deaths were documented during childbirth. In 73.7% of cases, the delivery was handled by an OB-GYN; in 14.5%, by a general practitioner.</p>

      <section id="midwives">
        <h2>The Marginalized Role of Midwives</h2>
        <p>One of the most glaring absences in this model is that of professional midwives. Including them could relieve pressure on hospitals, improve birthing experiences, and provide more respectful, continuous care.</p>

        <h2>What Needs to Change</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Strengthen primary care to manage uncomplicated births.</li>
          <li>Bring midwives back into the public system.</li>
          <li>Ensure safe, informed, and respectful births as a basic right.</li>
          <li>Redesign hospitals to honor movement, privacy, and the natural timing of birth.</li>
          <li>Open a public conversation about the risks of normalizing surgery as the default.</li>
