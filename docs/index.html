  <h1>When Birth Becomes an Emergency: Delivering Under Pressure in Mexico</h1>
  <p class="byline">By Scarlett Lindero</p>

  <p>In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as "emergency procedures."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>

  <blockquote>“Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time,” explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.</blockquote>

  <h2>A System That Centralizes and Excludes</h2>
  <p>Mexico's healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer. The first level—clinics and health centers—is meant to manage uncomplicated pregnancies...</p>

  <h2>Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h2>
  <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses...</p>

  <h2>The Numbers Don’t Lower Mortality</h2>
  <p>C-section rates vary across states, but all exceed the 15% threshold recommended by the WHO—and the national average of 56.1%...</p>

  <p>In 2024, 76 maternal deaths were documented during childbirth. In 73.7% of cases, the delivery was handled by an OB-GYN; in 14.5%, by a general practitioner.</p>

  <div style="min-height:437px" id="datawrapper-vis-sHXuA">
    <script defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sHXuA/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-sHXuA"></script>
    <noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sHXuA/full.png" alt="" /></noscript>
  </div>

  <p>Nearly half of these deaths (48.7%) occurred after an emergency C-section—the most lethal type of delivery recorded...</p>

  <h2>The Marginalized Role of Midwives</h2>
  <p>Despite their training and experience, midwives have been systematically excluded from the public health system...</p>

  <h2>Giving Birth Without a Specialist</h2>
  <p>The data also shows that in many hospitals, hundreds—or even thousands—of births were attended without a certified OB-GYN...</p>

    <noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xlb4j/full.png" alt="" /></noscript>
  </div>

  <h2>When Choice Isn’t Really an Option</h2>
  <p>Lack of information also shapes many women’s experience in the obstetric system...</p>

  <h2>The Price of What’s Left Unspoken</h2>
  <p>The routine use of C-sections comes at a high cost for the healthcare system...</p>

  <h2>What Needs to Change</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Strengthen primary care to manage uncomplicated births.</li>
    <li>Bring midwives back into the public system.</li>
    <li>Ensure safe, informed, and respectful births as a basic right.</li>
    <li>Redesign hospitals to honor movement, privacy, and the natural timing of birth.</li>
    <li>Open a public conversation about the risks of normalizing surgery as the default.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In Mexico, birth has become a surgical intervention. As C-section rates continue to rise, the structural conditions that make them inevitable remain unaddressed. Placing this debate at the center is not just a matter of public health: it’s a matter of rights.</p>
