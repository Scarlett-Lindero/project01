        <p>In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as "emergency procedures."</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>
          <blockquote>“Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time,” explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.</blockquote>

          <p>Mexico's healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer. Since 2010, public policy has focused on moving births to second-level hospitals, effectively disabling many first-level units—even those with trained personnel, proper equipment, and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>The result is a saturated hospital system unable to support physiological birth. “What Seguro Popular did was shut down the first level—it didn’t strengthen it. Now, hospitals are overrun with births that could be handled elsewhere,” says Argüello.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-4">Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h3>
        <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses—like “fetal distress” or “cephalopelvic disproportion”—which, while possible, have become routine justifications for fast intervention.</p>
        <blockquote>“When they tell you, ‘Your baby is suffering. We need to get them out now,’ of course you say yes. Women agree. Families agree. No one wants to risk the baby’s life. But that’s not always a real emergency,” Argüello warns.</blockquote>

          <p>In 2024, 76 maternal deaths were documented during childbirth. In 73.7% of cases, the delivery was handled by an OB-GYN; in 14.5%, by a general practitioner.</p>
