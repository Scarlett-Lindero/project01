  <h1>When Birth Becomes an Emergency</h1>
  <h2>Delivering Under Pressure in Mexico</h2>
  <p>By Scarlett Lindero</p>

  <p class="lede">
    In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as “emergency procedures.”
  </p>

  <h3>Obstetric Care and Hospital Saturation</h3>
  <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2PmGg/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time,” explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>A System That Centralizes and Excludes</h3>
  <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/91WTC/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p>Mexico's healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer. Since 2010, public policy has focused on moving births to second-level hospitals, effectively disabling many first-level units—even those with trained personnel, proper equipment, and infrastructure. The result is a saturated hospital system unable to support physiological birth.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “What Seguro Popular did was shut down the first level—it didn’t strengthen it. Now, hospitals are overrun with births that could be handled elsewhere,” says Argüello.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h3>
  <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses—like “fetal distress” or “cephalopelvic disproportion”—which, while possible, have become routine justifications for fast intervention.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “When they tell you, ‘Your baby is suffering. We need to get them out now,’ of course you say yes. But that’s not always a real emergency,” Argüello warns.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>The Numbers Don’t Lower Mortality</h3>
  <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HDJMb/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p>In 2024, 76 maternal deaths were documented during childbirth. In 73.7% of cases, the delivery was handled by an OB-GYN; in 14.5%, by a general practitioner.</p>

  <h3>Death After Delivery: By Birth Type</h3>
  <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sHXuA/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p>Nearly half of these deaths (48.7%) occurred after an emergency C-section—the most lethal type of delivery recorded. Another 30.3% followed an unassisted vaginal birth, and 17.1% came after a scheduled C-section.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “The quality of care doesn’t depend only on who attends—it depends on the system that surrounds them,” says Argüello.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>The Marginalized Role of Midwives</h3>
  <p>One of the most glaring absences in this model is that of professional midwives. Despite their training and experience, they’ve been systematically excluded from the public health system. Including them could relieve pressure on hospitals, improve birthing experiences, and provide more respectful, continuous care.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Midwives are not a backup option. They’re essential to easing hospital overload and returning childbirth to a space where women can choose,” Argüello points out.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Births Without a Specialist</h3>
  <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xlb4j/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p>In many hospitals, hundreds—or even thousands—of births were attended without a certified OB-GYN. The most extreme case is the Hospital de la Mujer in Mexico City, where 3,833 births occurred without a specialist.</p>

  <h3>When Choice Isn’t Really an Option</h3>
  <p>Lack of information also shapes many women’s experience in the obstetric system. Few know the risks associated with C-sections—such as placenta accreta, future pregnancy complications, or anesthesia effects—and even fewer are told about the benefits of vaginal birth.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “There's talk of empowerment, especially in private care—that women can choose when and how to give birth. But if that choice isn’t backed by full information, it’s just the illusion of freedom,” says Argüello.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>What Needs to Change</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Strengthen primary care to manage uncomplicated births.</li>
    <li>Bring midwives back into the public system.</li>
    <li>Ensure safe, informed, and respectful births as a basic right.</li>
    <li>Redesign hospitals to honor movement, privacy, and natural timing.</li>
    <li>Open a public conversation about the risks of normalizing surgery as the default.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In Mexico, birth has become a surgical intervention. As C-section rates continue to rise, the structural conditions that make them inevitable—saturation, misinformation, institutional design—remain unaddressed. Placing this debate at the center is not just a matter of public health: it’s a matter of rights.</p>
