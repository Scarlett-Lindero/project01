    <h1>When Birth Becomes an Emergency</h1>
    <h2>Delivering Under Pressure in Mexico</h2>
    <p>By Scarlett Lindero</p>

    <p class="lede">In Mexico, more and more women are giving birth without being able to choose how. In 2024, over half of all hospital births were C-sections. According to data from the National Health Information System (SINAC), 56.1% of births were resolved through surgical intervention. In total, 792,152 cesarean sections were performed—and more than half of them, 52.1%, were classified as “emergency procedures.”</p>

    <h3>Obstetric Care and Hospital Saturation</h3>

    <p>Far from responding solely to medical needs, the high rate of C-sections reveals an obstetric care model deeply shaped by hospital saturation, staff shortages, and the breakdown of alternatives like first-level care or professional midwifery.</p>
    <blockquote>“Hospitals are overwhelmed with low-risk births. Deliveries that could be managed in clinics end up in operating rooms due to lack of space, personnel—or simply time,” explains Hilda Argüello, a researcher at the Maternal Mortality Observatory.</blockquote>

    <h3>A System That Centralizes and Excludes</h3>
    <iframe src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/91WTC/1/" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    <p>Mexico’s healthcare system is structured in tiers that determine the type of care each facility can offer. Since 2010, public policy has focused on moving births to second-level hospitals, effectively disabling many first-level units—even those with trained personnel, proper equipment, and infrastructure. The result is a saturated hospital system unable to support physiological birth.</p>
    <blockquote>“What Seguro Popular did was shut down the first level—it didn’t strengthen it. Now, hospitals are overrun with births that could be handled elsewhere,” says Argüello.</blockquote>

    <h3>Recycled Diagnoses, Conditioned Decisions</h3>
    <p>Most emergency C-sections are based on common clinical diagnoses—like “fetal distress” or “cephalopelvic disproportion”—which, while possible, have become routine justifications for fast intervention.</p>
    <blockquote>“When they tell you, ‘Your baby is suffering. We need to get them out now,’ of course you say yes. But that’s not alw
